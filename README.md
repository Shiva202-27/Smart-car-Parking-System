Creating a smart car parking system with an Arduino, IR sensor, servo motor, and LCD display involves integrating these components to detect car presence, control parking barriers, and display parking status. Here's how you can build such a system:

Components Needed:
Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
IR sensors (for detecting car presence)
Servo motor (for controlling barriers)
LCD display (e.g., 16x2 LCD)
Power supply (batteries or adapter)
Breadboard and jumper wires
Resistors and capacitors (as needed)
Push buttons (optional, for manual override)
Ultrasonic sensors (optional, for precise distance measurement)
